imgur

	A bash script for OS X and Linux that uploads an image to imgur and copies 
	the image URL to the clipboard.

	Usage: imgur <filename>

	  Imgur will print the URL, and put the delete page's URL on stderr. If
	  you're on a Mac or have xsel/xclip, the image URL will also be copied
	  to the clipboard.

	Prerequisite: curl
	    Optional: pbcopy (included in OS X), xsel, or xclip
