A bash script for OS X and Linux that uploads an image to imgur and copies 
the image URL to the clipboard.

Usage: imgur <filename>
 
  Imgur will print the URL, and put the delete page's URL on stderr. If
  you're on a Mac or have xsel/xclip, the image URL will also be copied
  to the clipboard.

Prerequisite: curl
    Optional: pbcopy (included in OS X), xsel, or xclip
